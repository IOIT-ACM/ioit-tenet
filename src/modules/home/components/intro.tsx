        T.E.N.E.T goes beyond just an abbreviation of 5 niches. This event in
        its inception is an amalgamation of ideas where professionalism meets
        the academia. This is an event where students learn, connect, grow and
        most importantly have an experience worth remembering. From E-summit to
        eSports and from Techfiesta to IOIT MUN&apos;24 and Creator&apos;s
        Conclave, TENET, an event organised by the IOIT ACM Student Chapter has
        something for everyone.
